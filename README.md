## Features

Draftail aims for a mouse-free, keyboard-centric experience. Most formatting can be done by using common keyboard shortcuts, inspired by Google Docs and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

Here are important features worth highlighting:

- Support for [keyboard shortcuts](https://www.draftail.org/docs/keyboard-shortcuts). Lots of them!
- Paste from Word. Or any other editor.
- Autolists – start a line with `-` , `*` , `1.` to create a list item.
- Shortcuts for heading levels `##`, code blocks ` ``` `, and more.
- Undo / redo – until the end of times.
- Common text types: headings, paragraphs, quotes, lists.
- Common text styles: Bold, italic, and many more.
- API to build custom controls for links, images, and more.
