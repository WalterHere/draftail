# Draftail user guide

Draftail is a rich text editor built for websites of all shapes and sizes. It aims for a mouse-free, keyboard-centric experience. Most formatting can be done by using common keyboard shortcuts, inspired by [Google Docs](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/179738) and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## Browser and device support

Draftail supports all modern **desktop** browsers. There are [known issues](https://github.com/springload/draftail/issues/138) in Internet Explorer - your mileage may vary.

For mobile devices, Draftail is tested on the latest versions of iOS and Android. Support is limited - there are many known issues there as well, especially with custom keyboards like [Google's GBoard keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin&hl=en) or [SwiftKey](https://swiftkey.com/).
